Index is the main page.

Index passes information to conversation_page and redirects to it. The response is generated directly on the conversation_page.

What we want to achieve is:

The Index page passes information to the conversation_page.

The conversation_page receives the information and generates a response using an API.

Output: a summary (which is displayed) and questions (which are stored for later).

If the 'quiz' button is clicked, it redirects to the quiz page.

The quiz page displays the stored questions. We will only use multiple-choice questions here.

After a selection is made, either show the answer immediately or store it, and finally provide a total score and a conclusion.

It needs to be possible to use the generated questions and answers to make new prompt responses.

In other words, it must store its own output (the summary/questions) and use that, along with the user's new input, for future interactions.
